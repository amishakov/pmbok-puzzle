## PMBOK 6 - PMP Process Group Game.

This Puzzle has been gotten from the http://inpmi.ru and adjusted to the PMBOK 6th edition. 
The INPMI site was closed for some reason but was very helpful in preparing for the PMPÂ® Exam.

RMC has their own process chart game (by Rita's book. Different from the PMBOK one, but helpful as well):
